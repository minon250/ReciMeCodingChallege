# ReciMe App

This is the coding challenge of the **ReciMe** app, a recipe management application. While the current version of the whole app is not production grade, I've used production level code in places throughout the app to showcase my skills.

## Areas for Improvement

-   Time handling: The app's implementation of prep time and cook time may be flawed, as I wasn't sure what the consistent metric was.

## Known Bugs

-   Quantity calculation: The calculation that takes place when setting the quantity of an ingredient using the updated number of serves is known to be incorrect.

## Conclusion

Overall, the **ReciMe** app is a work in progress and there are still areas that need to be improved. However, the use of production level code in certain parts of the app demonstrates my abilities as a developer. I am always looking for ways to improve and welcome feedback on how to make the app better.
